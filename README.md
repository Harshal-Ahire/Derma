## **About**
- End-to-end web app for **7-class skin lesion classification** using Googleâ€™s Vision Transformer (ViT) model hosted on Hugging Face.  
- Model trained on **Marmal88's HAM10000-derived Skin Cancer Dataset (13,354 images)**.  
- Achieves **96.95% validation accuracy**.  
- Includes **Grad-CAM visualizations** for model interpretability.

## **Model Overview**

| Parameter                     | Description                                                                 |
|-------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Image size**                 | 600Ã—600 px; all images resized to a consistent dimension for the model.    |
| **Train/Validation Split**     | Stratified by lesion type; maintains class proportions in both sets.       |
| **Optimizer**                  | Adam; updates model weights efficiently to minimize loss.                  |
| **Learning Rate (LR)**         | 1e-4 (0.0001); controls the step size during weight updates.               |
| **Batch Size**                 | 32; number of images processed at a time before updating model weights.    |
| **Epochs**                     | 5; each image in the training set is seen 5 times during training.         |
| **Train Accuracy**             | 96.14%; performance on the training set.                                   |
| **Validation Accuracy**        | 96.95%; performance on unseen data.                                        |
| **Validation Loss**            | 0.10; low value indicates confident and accurate predictions.              |
